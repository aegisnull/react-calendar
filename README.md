# Altomobile React Challenge Luis Tellez

## Description

This is a simple React application that displays a calendar with the current month and allows the user to select a date. The user can also add events to the calendar by clicking on a date and filling out a form. The events are saved in the browser's local storage. (for now).

## Development environment

- Node.js v18.13.0
- npm v9.4.0
- React v18.2.0
- Vite v4.1.0

Even though I prefer to use a meta framework like Next.js for it's improved developer experience and overall better performance, I decided to use Vite for this challenge to focus on a base React Experience that would allow React developers of all levels to understand the code easily.

Vite provides a nearly identical experience to Create React App, but with a much faster build time and a more flexible configuration. Therefore, I decided to use it for this challenge.

## Roadmap

- [] Display a calendar with the current month
- [] Allow the user to select a date
- [] Allow the user to add events to the calendar
- [] Save events in the browser's local storage
